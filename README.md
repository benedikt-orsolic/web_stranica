# Web Stranica

## TODO

* Browser dosn't warn in the same way about wrong input on register page
* Sanitise user input
* why is blog post upload not done using ajax??
  allow clinet to pic number of posts to download, maybe would make faster loading if went by 1, 2, 3, then 5, or 10
  once post uploaded get that first post and tac it on top

  this might work
* Convert markdown to php on upload
    makes for faster loading
    doesn't allow for future updates to converter
    or store markdown and html versions in db? Don't think that one is good
