# Web Stranica

## TODO

* Browser doesn't warn in the same way about wrong input on register page
* Sanitize user input

* Convert markdown to php on upload
    makes for faster loading
    doesn't allow for future updates to converter
    or store markdown and html versions in db? Don't think that one is good

* Blog page add img support.
* Allow editing of posts

## Notes

* file_put_contents ( file , msg, FILE_APPEND | LOCK_EX);
* mysqli_error($dbConn)
*
